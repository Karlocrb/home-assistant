# About

Webhook Relay addon enables Home Assistant and any other services running inside internal network to receive webhooks from public services such as IFTTT, Zapier, Mailgun or pretty much anything.

It works by opening a connection to the public cloud service and giving you your unique "webhooks inbox" URL which you can supply to 3rd party services.

Webhook Relay is particularly useful when:

* You cannot access your router to configure port forwarding
* Router doesn't support port forwarding
* Your ISP blocks inbound connections
* You don't have a static IP address
* Server that is hosting your home automation system is changing IP, location

## Installation
